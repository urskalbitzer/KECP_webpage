	abstract = {With 60\% of all primate species now threatened with extinction and many species only persisting in small populations in forest fragments, conservation action is urgently needed. But what type of action? Here we argue that restoration of primate habitat will be an essential component of strategies aimed at conserving primates and preventing the extinctions that may occur before the end of the century and propose that primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts. To do this we gathered a team of academics from around the world with experience in restoration so that we could provide examples of why primate restoration ecology is needed, outline how primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts of tropical forest, review what little is known about how primate populations respond to restoration efforts, and make specific recommendations of the next steps needed to make restoration of primate populations successful. We set four priorities: (1) academics must effectively communicate both the value of primates and the need for restoration; (2) more research is needed on how primates contribute to forest restoration; (3) more effort must be put into Masters and PhD level training for tropical country nationals; and finally (4) more emphasis is needed to monitor the responses of regenerating forest and primate populations where restoration efforts are initiated. We are optimistic that populations of many threatened species can recover, and extinctions can be prevented, but only if concerted large-scale efforts are made soon and if these efforts include primate habitat restoration.},

Flies marked in nonhuman primate groups were recaptured in human areas (19/28,615 recaptured). Metabarcoding of the flies in nonhuman primate groups revealed the DNA of multiple eukaryotic primate parasites. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of flies to serve as vectors between nonhuman primates, livestock and humans at this biodiverse interface.},

	abstract = {World-­wide declines in arthropod abundance and diversity are a major concern, particularly given their importance in ecosystem functioning. Yet, data documenting long-­term trends are rare from the tropics, particularly the Afrotropics. Here we evaluate changes in the arthropod communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda across almost four decades. Systematic sweep-­net sampling was conducted in two forested sections of the park that had been logged and in one old-­growth forest area over 12 consecutive months in 1983/1984 and 2020/2021. This data was augmented with intermittent samples taken in 1986 and 1995. Arthropod abundance declined in all areas, but only significantly so in the moderately logged forestry compartment (41\%). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that community compositions of arthropods differed between the censuses. Understanding the drivers of changes in the arthropod communities is difficult as the system is complex and dynamic. We document an increase in temperature, but no change in rainfall, increases in 11 mammal species, including a marked increase in elephant numbers, and changes in forest structure. We also report on changes in the landscape outside of the park, which includes the human population increasing by a factor of four and agricultural intensification that now includes the use of pesticides. We document that many components of the ecosystem we studied changed simultaneously, which signals that for effective conservation planning, more long-­term multi-­disciplinary efforts are needed.},

	abstract = {The ability to move allows animals to optimize their fitness by responding to spatial variability in their environment, such as changes in the location of food resources, predators, parasites, competitors, or reproductive partners. However, many animals remain within a limited area throughout their lives. Such site fidelity has been reported for social groups of nonhuman primates and other mammals over many years or even decades. The few studies that have addressed and confirmed long-term site fidelity in primates have focused on species feeding on presumably unevenly distributed food resources, such as fruit, which indicates heterogeneous habitat quality, a factor often considered to decrease site fidelity. However, if we want to test and extend theories about the ecological factors linked to site fidelity, including the role of habitat quality heterogeneity, studies about species feeding on more evenly distributed foods, such as leaves, are essential. Therefore, we here investigate the long-term ranging pattern of the leaf-eating (and endangered) red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park. For the period from 2010 until 2019, we established home range density estimates (HRDE) for our main study group for annual, 6-month, and 3-month periods via “autocorrelated kernel density estimation.” Then, we compared changes in these HRDEs across time using three metrics: (1) the “overlap” of HRDEs, which is a measure of similarity between (probability) distributions that reflect the estimated home ranges, (2) the distance between the centroids of the HRDEs, and (3) the distances between the points of maximum density of HRDEs. Our results indicate high home site fidelity for red colobus, as our study group was still using the same area after 10 years. Although these results are as expected, it is important to note that this pattern is similar in primates with other types of diet (including fruit). Thus, going forward, it will be crucial to quantitatively assess heterogeneity in food distribution for different types of diet and study additional factors that may lead to such a high site fidelity in many primates.},

Here we provide an evaluation of park effectiveness by quantifying changes in the abundance of the commonly occurring ungulates (bushbuck - Tragelaphus scriptus; red duiker - Cephalophus harveyi; blue duiker - Cephalophus moniticola, bushpigs - Potomochoerus larvatus, and giant forest hogs - Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), and African elephants (forest elephants - Loxodonta cyclotis, savanna elephants Loxodonta africana, and their hybrids) in Kibale National Park, Uganda and consider the financial commitment needed to ensure protection. Following the upgrading of the protection of Kibale from a forest reserve to a national park, wildlife populations generally increased. Bushpigs are an exception and their populations appear stable. The increases of ungulate and elephant pop­ ulations typically happened soon after park establishment, with the exception of the giant forest hog that only recently showed an increase. We conducted an assessment of Uganda Wildlife Authorities budget and those of the small NGOs working in the area and considered the contri­ bution that Makerere University Biological Field Stations makes to the community. This analysis indicates that with a small budget UWA and its collaborators have been successful in protecting the park’s ungulate and elephant populations. While the past decades have demonstrated the park’s ability to conserve biodiversity with limited resources, the changing climate and mounting pressures faced by the park will necessitate significantly increased investments.},

	abstract = {Many primate populations are threatened by human actions and a central tool used for their protection is establishing protected areas. However, even if populations in such areas are protected from hunting and deforestation, they still may be threatened by factors such as climate change and its cascading impacts on habitat quality and disease dynamics. Here we provide a long‐term and geographically widespread population assessment of the five common diurnal primates of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Over 7 year‐long or longer census efforts that spanned 52 years, our team walked 1466 km, and recorded 480 monkey groups. Populations were generally relatively stable with a few exceptions, for which no apparent causative factors could be identified. This stability is unexpected as many ecological changes documented over the last 34+ years (e.g., decreasing food abundance and quality) were predicted to have negative impacts. Populations of some species declined at some sites but increased at others. This highlights the need for large, protected areas so that declines in particular areas are countered by gains in others. Kibale has large areas of regenerating forest and this most recent survey revealed that after 20+ years, forest regeneration in many of these areas appears sufficient to sustain sizeable primate populations, except for blue monkeys that have not colonized these areas. Indeed, the average primate abundance in the regenerating forest was only 8.1\% lower than in neighboring old‐growth forest. Thus, park‐wide primate abundance has likely increased, despite many pressures on the park having risen; however, some areas in the park remain to be assessed. Our study suggests that the restoration, patrolling, and community outreach efforts of the Uganda Wildlife Authority and their partners have contributed significantly to protecting the park and its animals.},

To understand those choices and therefore the importance of different food resources, many studies estimate food preferences by applying electivity indices that account for resource availabilities. However, the general applicability of electivity indices in biologically relevant foraging scenarios is unclear. Our major aims were to find effective methods to estimate animals' food choices and to investigate long-term food choices and underlying nutritional goals of the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, an endangered folivore. We used simulations of different foraging conditions to evaluate the applicability of electivity indices in biologically relevant scenarios to help interpret our results. Then, we used long-term data collected between 2006 and 2016 on the feeding behavior and ecology of red colobus to determine the consumption frequencies of different foods and their food preferences. Based on these results and nutritional concentrations of young leaves of frequently consumed tree species, we investigated the importance of the protein-to-fiber ratio in their diet. Our simulations highlight limitations of electivity indices in biologically relevant foraging scenarios. Further, red colobus clearly chose young leaves over other plant parts, and, considering species and plant part, red colobus fed on many different items, but few dominated their diet. The availability and spatial distribution varied across the most consumed foods, but red colobus preferences remained mostly stable over time. Protein-to-fiber ratio had no association with preference but with consumption frequencies of different young leaves. The limitations of electivity indices in different foraging conditions underline the importance of comparing food preferences with consumption frequencies to assess the importance of different food resources. Our results provide a robust understanding of the food choices and nutritional goals of a leaf-eating animal that can ultimately be used for implementing more effective conservation measures by directing habitat protection or restoration efforts toward these resources.},
