I am a Biologist and Biological Anthropologist at Vancouver Island University with broad interest, but I am foremost a conservation scientist and humanitarian. I have had the pleasure to conduct research in Kibale National Park, Uganda, for 34+ years, where I focus on the roles that disease, nutrition, stress, and climate change play in determining primate abundance, while also exploring how to best to conserve the world's biodiversity.
