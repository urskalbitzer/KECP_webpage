My research is situated at the crossroads of GIScience, human geography, and digital geography. My primary research interest is to model interactions specially in a spatial context. I have developed a suit of methods and have applied them on a variety of application scenarios ranging from digital geography, urban geography, to biodiversity conservation and ecology.
